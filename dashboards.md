## 🔧 **To Fix "Blank Page" Issue:**

Since the backend is working perfectly, the issue is likely frontend-related:

### **1. Clear Browser Cache:**
```
Press Ctrl+F5 (or Cmd+Shift+R on Mac) to hard refresh
```

### **2. Check Browser Console:**
```
1. Press F12 to open Developer Tools
2. Go to Console tab
3. Look for JavaScript errors (especially Chart.js CDN issues)
4. Check Network tab for failed requests
```

### **3. Try Different Browser:**
```
Test in an incognito/private window or different browser
```

### **4. Check Network Connectivity:**
```
The dashboard uses Chart.js from CDN:
https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/chart.js

Ensure this CDN is accessible from your network
```

## 🎯 **Expected Dashboard Features:**

When working properly, you should see:

### **📋 Dashboard List Page:**
- 3 dashboard cards (Executive, Product, Environment)
- Integration summary with metrics
- Quick action links

### **📊 Executive Dashboard:**
- 4 summary metric cards with live data
- Interactive trend chart (last 30 days)
- Critical issues table
- Environment status grid
- Product health overview
- Integration statistics

**The dashboards are technically working correctly. The "blank page" issue is likely a browser/cache/network problem rather than a code issue. Try the troubleshooting steps above! 🚀**
