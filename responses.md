Absolutely! Let's scope out a comprehensive JIRA integration app that works seamlessly with your existing Sentry-Product system. This will create a powerful three-way integration: **Sentry ↔ Products ↔ JIRA**.

## 🎯 **JIRA Integration App Scope**

### **Core Concept:**
Create a `apps/jira` app that:
1. **Syncs JIRA projects and issues** locally
2. **Maps JIRA projects to your Products** (similar to Sentry-Product mapping)
3. **Tracks Sentry→JIRA ticket creation** and status
4. **Provides unified Product→Sentry→JIRA visibility**

## 🤔 **Questions for You:**

1. **JIRA Setup**: Do you use JIRA Cloud or Server? What's your current automation setup?

2. **Scope Priority**: Which phase interests you most? All of it, or focus on specific parts first?

3. **Business Rules**: What triggers should create JIRA tickets? (e.g., critical errors, high event counts, specific products)

4. **Team Workflow**: How do your teams currently handle Sentry→JIRA workflows? What's manual vs automated?

5. **Integration Depth**: Do you want full bidirectional sync, or primarily Sentry→JIRA creation?

**This would create a powerful unified system where your Products become the central organizing principle for both error monitoring (Sentry) and issue tracking (JIRA)!**

What aspects of this scope excite you most? Should we start building this out? 🚀

Based on my comprehensive review of the JIRA integration documentation against the actual implementation, here's what I found:

## 📋 **Implementation Status Analysis**

### ✅ **What's COMPLETE and Working:**

#### **Phase 1: Core JIRA Integration**
- ✅ **Data Models**: All models implemented (`JiraOrganization`, `JiraProject`, `JiraIssue`, `SentryJiraLink`, `JiraSyncLog`)
- ✅ **JIRA API Client**: Full implementation with authentication, connection testing, issue creation/querying
- ✅ **Sync Services**: Complete `JiraSyncService` with project and issue syncing
- ✅ **Admin Interface**: Comprehensive admin with connection testing, bulk operations, statistics
- ✅ **Management Commands**: `sync_jira` with all documented flags (`--test-connection`, `--dry-run`, `--force`)

#### **Phase 2: Sentry-JIRA Linking**
- ✅ **SentryJiraLink Model**: Bidirectional linking with sync preferences
- ✅ **SentryJiraLinkService**: Complete service with `create_jira_issue_from_sentry` method
- ✅ **Smart Integration**: Automatic description generation, intelligent labeling
- ✅ **JIRA Views**: Web interface for creating tickets from Sentry issues

### ❌ **What's MISSING and Needs Implementation:**

#### **1. Sentry Admin Actions (Critical Gap)**
The documentation claims:
> "Via Sentry issue admin: 1. Select Sentry issues 2. Use 'Create JIRA tickets' action"

**❌ MISSING**: No admin action in `apps/sentry/admin.py` for creating JIRA tickets from selected Sentry issues.

#### **2. JIRA Templates (Missing Frontend)**
**❌ MISSING**: No JIRA dashboard templates - `apps/jira/templates/` directory doesn't exist.

Expected templates from documentation:
- JIRA Dashboard
- Organizations list
- Project detail views
- Sentry-JIRA links interface

#### **3. Product Integration in JIRA Projects Admin**
**❌ PARTIAL**: While JIRA projects have product mapping, there's no bulk assignment feature like Sentry has.

## 🚀 **Let's Complete the Implementation**

I can help you implement the missing pieces to match the documentation. Here are the priorities:

### **Priority 1: Sentry Admin Action for JIRA Ticket Creation**
Add the "Create JIRA tickets" bulk action to Sentry issues admin.

### **Priority 2: JIRA Dashboard Templates**
Create the missing dashboard templates:
- Main JIRA dashboard
- Organizations list
- Sentry-JIRA links view

### **Priority 3: JIRA Projects Bulk Assignment**
Add bulk product assignment for JIRA projects (like Sentry has).

### **Priority 4: Enhanced Cross-System Visibility**
- Update Product admin to show JIRA project counts
- Add JIRA links display in Sentry issue admin

**Which of these would you like me to implement first? I recommend starting with the Sentry admin action since that's a core workflow mentioned prominently in the documentation.**

Would you like me to:
1. **Implement the missing Sentry admin action for creating JIRA tickets**
2. **Create the missing JIRA dashboard templates**
3. **Add JIRA projects bulk assignment to products**
4. **All of the above in sequence**

What's your preference?
