Absolutely! Let's scope out a comprehensive JIRA integration app that works seamlessly with your existing Sentry-Product system. This will create a powerful three-way integration: **Sentry ↔ Products ↔ JIRA**.

## 🎯 **JIRA Integration App Scope**

### **Core Concept:**
Create a `apps/jira` app that:
1. **Syncs JIRA projects and issues** locally
2. **Maps JIRA projects to your Products** (similar to Sentry-Product mapping)
3. **Tracks Sentry→JIRA ticket creation** and status
4. **Provides unified Product→Sentry→JIRA visibility**

→ Link Sentry issue to JIRA ticket
→ Update both systems with cross-references
```

### **2. Status Synchronization**
```
JIRA ticket status change (Open→Done)
→ Update linked Sentry issue status (unresolved→resolved)
→ Add comment to Sentry with JIRA resolution info
```

- Sentry error rate trends
- JIRA ticket velocity
- Combined health metrics
- Team workload distribution
```

## 🤔 **Questions for You:**

1. **JIRA Setup**: Do you use JIRA Cloud or Server? What's your current automation setup?

2. **Scope Priority**: Which phase interests you most? All of it, or focus on specific parts first?

3. **Business Rules**: What triggers should create JIRA tickets? (e.g., critical errors, high event counts, specific products)

4. **Team Workflow**: How do your teams currently handle Sentry→JIRA workflows? What's manual vs automated?

5. **Integration Depth**: Do you want full bidirectional sync, or primarily Sentry→JIRA creation?

**This would create a powerful unified system where your Products become the central organizing principle for both error monitoring (Sentry) and issue tracking (JIRA)!**

What aspects of this scope excite you most? Should we start building this out? 🚀
