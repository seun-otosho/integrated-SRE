## 🎛️ **How to Use Your New System**

### **1. Set Up JIRA Organizations**
```bash
# Start your server
python manage.py runserver

# Go to JIRA admin
http://localhost:8000/admin/jira/jiraorganization/add/

# Add your JIRA Cloud details:
# - Name: "Your Company JIRA"
# - Base URL: "https://yourcompany.atlassian.net"
# - Username: your-email@company.com
# - API Token: (create at Account Settings > Security > API tokens)
```

### **2. Test Connection & Sync**
```bash
# Test connection via admin or command
python manage.py sync_jira --test-connection

# Sync projects and issues
python manage.py sync_jira

# Force sync specific organization
python manage.py sync_jira --org "Your Company" --force
```

### **3. Map JIRA Projects to Products**
```bash
# Go to JIRA Projects admin
http://localhost:8000/admin/jira/jiraproject/

# Use bulk assignment (like Sentry projects):
1. Select projects → "Bulk assign to product"
2. Choose your business product
3. Create unified Product → Sentry → JIRA visibility
```

### **4. Create JIRA Issues from Sentry**
```bash
# Via Sentry issue admin:
1. Select Sentry issues
2. Use "Create JIRA tickets" action
3. Choose JIRA project, issue type, priority
4. Automatic linking and status sync

# Or programmatically:
from apps.jira.services import SentryJiraLinkService
service = SentryJiraLinkService()
success, jira_issue, message = service.create_jira_issue_from_sentry(
    sentry_issue=sentry_issue,
    jira_project=jira_project,
    issue_type="Bug",
    priority="High"
)
```

## 📊 **Three-Way Integration Architecture**

```
🏢 Products (Business Logic)
    ↕️
🔍 Sentry Projects (Technical Monitoring)  
    ↕️
🎫 JIRA Projects (Issue Tracking)
```

### **Unified Workflows:**
1. **Product Dashboard** shows Sentry errors AND JIRA tickets
2. **Sentry Issue** creates JIRA ticket with automatic linking
3. **JIRA Resolution** updates Sentry issue status
4. **Product Health** combines error rates + ticket velocity

## 🎯 **What You Can Do Right Now**

### **Immediate Actions:**
1. **Add your JIRA organization** in the admin
2. **Test the connection** to verify API access
3. **Run your first sync** to import projects and issues
4. **Map JIRA projects to your products** for unified visibility
5. **Create a test JIRA ticket** from a Sentry issue

### **Available URLs:**
- **JIRA Dashboard:** `http://localhost:8000/jira/`
- **JIRA Admin:** `http://localhost:8000/admin/jira/`
- **Organizations:** `http://localhost:8000/jira/organizations/`
- **Sentry-JIRA Links:** `http://localhost:8000/jira/links/`
