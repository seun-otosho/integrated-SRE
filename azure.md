python manage.py shell -c "
from datetime import timedelta
from django.utils import timezone

# Collect last 90 days of data
for days_back in range(0, 90, 7):  # Weekly chunks
    end_time = timezone.now() - timedelta(days=days_back)
    start_time = end_time - timedelta(days=7)
    # Run sync for this period
"
```

**📈 Long-term Storage Strategy:**
