## 🔍 **Product Reliability Analysis Results - Eye-Opening Insights!**

This analysis reveals some **critical insights** about your current product portfolio:

### 📊 **Current State Summary:**

| Product | Overall Score | Runtime | Quality | Operations | Status |
|---------|--------------|---------|---------|------------|---------|
| **Adora** | 19.9% | 0.0% | 34.6% | 0.0% | 🔴 **CRITICAL** |
| **Billing** | 9.5% | 0.0% | 0.0% | 0.0% | 🔴 **CRITICAL** |
| **CAIMS** | 21.5% | 0.0% | 40.0% | 0.0% | 🔴 **CRITICAL** |

### 🚨 **Key Findings:**

**🔥 Runtime Issues (0% across all products):**
- **185 critical errors** in Adora alone
- **0% resolution rate** - all issues remain unresolved
- High volume of recent errors (145 in last 30 days for Adora)

**✅ Code Quality Challenges:**
- **Adora**: Quality gate OK but only 11.6% test coverage, 29 bugs
- **Billing**: Quality gate ERROR, 206 bugs, 5,537 code smells
- **CAIMS**: No quality gate data available

**🎫 Operations Concerns:**
- High volume of JIRA issues (395 for Adora)
- Many high-priority items (51 for Adora)
- No clear incident management process

---

## 🎯 **Missing Data Points Identified:**

### **Critical Gaps for Better Reliability Scoring:**

#### **1. Sentry Resolution Data** ⚠️
- **Missing**: Issue resolution timestamps
- **Need**: Time to resolution, resolution status tracking
- **Impact**: Currently showing 0% resolution rate

#### **2. SonarCloud Historical Data** ⚠️
- **Missing**: Trend analysis over time
- **Need**: Quality gate history, improvement trends
- **Impact**: Can't track quality improvements

#### **3. JIRA SLA & Response Data** ⚠️
