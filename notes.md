Excellent! I've created a comprehensive **Product Reliability Dashboard framework** based on industry standards. Here's what I've designed for you:

## ðŸŽ¯ **Industry Standards Used:**

1. **Google SRE** - Error budgets and SLI/SLO approach
2. **DORA Metrics** - DevOps performance indicators
3. **Platform Engineering** - Multi-dimensional reliability scoring

## ðŸ“Š **Your Custom Reliability Framework:**

### **Multi-Dimensional Score (0-100%):**
- **ðŸ”¥ Runtime Reliability (40%)** - From Sentry errors & performance
- **âœ… Code Quality (30%)** - From SonarCloud quality gates & bugs
- **ðŸŽ« Operations (20%)** - From JIRA incident response & resolution
- **ðŸ”— System Health (10%)** - Cross-system integration health

### **Visual Dashboard Design:**
- **Portfolio Overview** - All products with health scores
- **Product Deep Dive** - Detailed breakdown per product
- **Historical Trends** - 90-day reliability evolution
- **Actionable Insights** - What needs attention and why

## ðŸš€ **Ready to Implement?**

I can start building this reliability dashboard system for you. Which would you prefer to tackle first:

### **Option A: Quick MVP (1-2 days)**
- Basic reliability calculation service
- Simple product scoring using your existing Sentry + SonarCloud data
- Basic dashboard view to see scores

### **Option B: Comprehensive Implementation (1-2 weeks)**  
- Full multi-dimensional scoring engine
- Advanced dashboard with trends and insights
- Integration with existing materialization system
- Alerting for reliability degradation

### **Option C: Start with Analysis (Today)**
- Analyze your current product data
- Calculate sample reliability scores
- Show you what the dashboard would look like with real data

**Which approach interests you most?** 

I'm excited to build this - it will give you powerful insights into your product portfolio's health and help prioritize engineering efforts based on actual reliability data! ðŸŽ¯
